# Secrets App

The Secrets App is a web application that allows users to share their secrets anonymously. Built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and CSS, this project serves as a platform for users to post their secrets without revealing their identity. It helped me in learning authentication using OAuth 2.0.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting:** Users can share their secrets without providing any personal information.
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** Implements OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
- **Secure:** Ensures the anonymity of users while sharing secrets.

## Usage

1. Users can access the home page and view secrets shared by others.

3. After authentication, users can share their secrets anonymously.
